# Dynamic-Web-Scraper-Export-to-Excel.py
This project is a dynamic web scraping tool built using Python, Selenium, and OpenPyXL that extracts structured data (book titles and prices) from a paginated website: Books to Scrape. It automates browser interaction, handles dynamic content loading, and seamlessly exports the scraped data to an Excel spreadsheet.
